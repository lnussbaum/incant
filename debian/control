Description: Incus frontend for declarative development environments
 Incant is a frontend for Incus that provides a declarative way to define and
 manage development environments. It simplifies the creation, configuration,
 and provisioning of Incus instances using YAML-based configuration files. It
 is inspired by Vagrant and intended as an Incus-based replacement.
